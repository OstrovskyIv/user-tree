# user-tree
Preface, this program is written in C++
(
Write a program to build a binary tree. Intelligence,
that need to be stored in the tree - this is a user file: date
birth, surname, place of birth. Generate tree data by numeric
sequences. The program should do:

1) construction of a binary search tree;
2) creating an empty tree,
3) output data in the form of a tree (use to separate elements
tabulation).
4) output data by traversing the tree in order (root-left-right).
5) inserting a new node into the tree.
6) removal of the selected node by the user from the tree.
7) deleting all tree nodes,
8) changing the selected node by the user from the tree.
9) determining the number of tree nodes.
10) output of tree data in sorted form.
11) output the tree to a text file.
12) extracting data from a text file and building a binary
tree.
13) search for all namesakes.
14) output the maximum of the values of its vertices and the number of vertices,
having this maximum value.
The program must provide menu-driven dialogue and control
input errors.
